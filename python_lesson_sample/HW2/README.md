To run program, open a terminal window. Type,

$ ./triangle.py

If the program doesn't run, check python with command "which python". If you have python3 installed, but not named by python3, replace the first line with following.

#!/usr/bin/env python


The program take 2 inputs, one for the character to build the triangle, the other one is the triangle base width.

Consider following test cases:
User doesn't enter anything when asked for an input for character.
User entered more than one characters.
User doesn't enter an odd number.
User entered an invalid number (The program might miss this case, fix it if you can)
